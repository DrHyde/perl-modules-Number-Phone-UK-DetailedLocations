This module does nothing on its own, but is an add-on for Number::Phone::UK,
to make the location() method more accurate.  I decided to distribute it
seperately because to include all this data as well as that for the national
numbering scheme would make the module ridiculously big.  Better to have this,
which will not be needed so often and is updated far less often, as a seperate
package.

To install it, do the usual dance:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
